    <div class="subsubheading" id="academics">
        <h3>Academics!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I am a third year student at the University of California, Santa Cruz and currently working on my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics. After my Bachelor's, I plan to enroll in the 4+1 Master's program in Computer Science with a desginated emphasis in Data Science. I enjoy a strong challenge in my coursework, so some my favorite classes are Applied Machine Learning, Numerical Analysis, and Probability Theory. This Spring Quarter I am enrolled in Principles of Computer Systems Design, Computional Models, and Personal Computers.</p>

    <div class="subsubheading" id="work">
        <h3>Hobbies!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I enjoy being outdoors, whether that's biking, walking, hiking, or playing basketball with some friends and family. I have also developed an interest in photography recently and like to take pictures of beautiful natual landscapes. I find that each of these activities give my mind a break from studying all day and help me stay in shape. Recently, I have also started to read a lot more. I love reading non-fiction books about self-improvement and Islam.</p>

    <div class="subsubheading" id="career">
        <h3>Career Goals!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Over the past year, I have been considering a couple options for a career in academia as a professor or in industry and a data scientist! I enjoy teaching, being in a position of mentorship, and research. I have been tutoring for a while and inspire my students to take on the same love for learning that my teachers has instilled in me. I believe that a fair intersection of these interests would be a research and development position in industry where there is still a strong collaborative and learning environment to push the world forward with innovation.</p>

    <div class="subsubheading" id="interests">
        <h3>Interests!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>My <i>professional</i> interests lie in <b>statistical and machine learning data science</b> using cluster and parallel computing. Recently, I have been working more with these technologies for research and in coursework which has been really engaging!</li>

                <li>My <i>personal</i> interests lie in <b>Islam and self-improvement</b>. There are many sciences to learn about in the religion of Islam, but currently, I am most interested in learning about mental health, theology, and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings upon him).</li>

                <li>In order to contine to constanly learn something new about these interests, I strive to read at least one article from <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/">Google AI Blog</a> or watch one educational video from Youtube about Computer Science or Islam per day.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>Website Implementation Goals:
        <ol>
            <li>A blog about what I am learning or developing.</li>
            <li>Some sort of tutorial series.</li>
            <li>Book notes and summaries from my favorite readings.</li>
            <li>Create an online resume and portfolio.</li>
        </ol>

    <div>This is my personal study playlist that I have been putting together since November 2019. It is lo-fi uptempo beats with little to no lyrics to minimize distraction and maximize productity.
