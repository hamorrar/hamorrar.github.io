        <h3>Academics!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I am a senior student at the University of California, Santa Cruz and currently working on my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. After my Bachelor's, I plan to continue to earn my Ph.D in Computer Science. My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Operating/Distributed Systems. This Fall quarter, I am enrolled in Database Systems I, Computer Architecture, and Distributed Systems.</p>

    <div class="subsubheading" id="work">
        <h3>Hobbies!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I enjoy being outdoors, whether that's biking, walking, hiking, or playing basketball with some friends and family. I find that each of these activities give my mind a break from studying all day and help me stay in shape. Recently, I have also started to read a lot more. I love reading non-fiction books about self-improvement.</p>

    <div class="subsubheading" id="career">
        <h3>Career Goals!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I am planning to get my Ph.D and work in industry as a researcher. I enjoy teaching, being in a position of mentorship, and research. I have been tutoring for 2 years and inspire my students to take on the same love for learning that my teachers has instilled in me. I believe that a fair intersection of these interests would be a research and development position in industry where there is still a strong collaborative and learning environment to push the world forward with innovation.</p>

        <h3>Interests!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <ul>
              <li>My professional interests lie in machine learning, distributed/operating systems. Recently, I have been working more with these technologies for research and in coursework which has been really engaging!</li>

                <li>In order to contine to constanly learn something new about these interests, I strive to read at least one article from
                  <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/">Google AI Blog</a> or watch one educational video from Youtube about Computer Science - I am currently watching from UCSC Professor Lindsey Kuper's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNPUF5QyWU8PydLG2cIJrCvnn5I_exhYx">Distributed Systems playlist</a> or Stanford's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSrTvUm384I9PV10koj_cqit9OfbJXEkq">MLSys Seminars</a> on YouTube. I will work to keep notes available on my website as I progress through these videos.
