        <h3>Academics!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I am a third year student at the University of California, Santa Cruz and I am double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I enjoy a good challenge in my coursework, so some my favorite classes are Artificial Intelligence, Numerical Analysis, Probability Theory. This Winter Quarter I am enrolled in Ordinary Differential Equations, Applied Bayesian Statistics, and Algorithmic Analysis.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I enjoy being outdoors, whether that's biking, walking, hiking, or playing basketball with some friends and family. I have also developed an interest in photography recently and like to take pictures of beautiful natual landscapes. I find that each of these activities give my mind a break from studying all day and help me stay in shape. Recently, I have also started to read a lot more. I love reading non-fiction books about self-improvement, Islam, and productivity.</p>

        <h3>Career Goals!</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Over the past year, I have been strongly considering a career in academia as a professor! I enjoy teaching, being in a position of mentorship, and research. I have been tutoring for a while and use my passion for the subject to push my students to take on the same love for learning into my students. My teaching philosophy is to be the teacher that I wish I had when I took the course.</p>
